The most commonly described three phases are:\n\nThe normal blood clotting process (hemostasis) involves three sequential phases that work together to stop bleeding after vascular injury. First, vascular spasm causes immediate vasoconstriction to reduce blood flow. Second, platelets adhere to the injury site and form a temporary platelet plug.
