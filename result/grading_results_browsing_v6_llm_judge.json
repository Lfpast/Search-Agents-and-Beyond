The most significant immediate consequences were:\n\n1. **Sharp economic decline**: Most Eastern European and former Soviet countries experienced a steep drop in economic output, with GDP falling dramatically in the early years of transition.\n\n2. **Massive unemployment**: As state-owned enterprises were privatized or closed, unemployment rates soared. By early 1994, 10-15% of the labor force in Eastern Europe was unemployed, with over 40% of those jobless for more than a year.\n\n3. **Hyperinflation and price instability**: The removal of price controls led to rapid inflation, eroding savings and reducing purchasing power.\n\n4. **Decline in living standards**: Real wages fell, poverty increased, and social safety nets deteriorated as governments struggled with fiscal constraints.\n\n5. **Industrial collapse**: Many inefficient state-owned industries could not compete in the new market environment and collapsed, leading to widespread deindustrialization.\n\n6. **Social dislocation**: The transition created significant social costs, including increased inequality, loss of job security, and psychological stress from economic uncertainty.\n\nThese negative effects were particularly severe because the transition occurred rapidly through \"shock therapy\" approaches in countries like Poland, which implemented comprehensive market reforms starting in January 1990. The initial economic contraction was so profound that it took most countries until the late 1990s to return to their pre-transition economic output levels.\n\n<answer>a steep decline in economic output and massive unemployment</answer>",

First, vascular spasm occurs where the smooth muscle in the vessel walls contracts to reduce blood flow. Second, platelets form a temporary plug at the injury site by adhering to exposed collagen and aggregating together.
