Edmund Barton became Australia's first prime minister on January 1, 1901, when he was appointed by the Governor-General to form a caretaker government after Federation.\n\n2. The first federal election was held on March 29-30, 1901, where Barton and his Protectionist Party won the most seats (though not a majority).\n\nSince the question specifically asks \"when was the first Australian prime minister elected?\" and uses the word \"elected,\" the most accurate answer would be the date of the first federal election in March 1901. However, it's worth noting that Barton was already serving as prime minister before this election, having been appointed on January 1, 1901.\n\nThe first Australian prime minister, Edmund Barton, was elected in the inaugural federal election held on March 29-30, 1901.\n\n<answer>29-30 March 1901</answer>",
