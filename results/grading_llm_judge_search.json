Traditionally, Colon Street in Cebu City has been widely recognized as the oldest street in the Philippines, established in 1565 during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent historical research suggests that Magallanes Street (also in Cebu City) might actually be older.\n\nColon Street has been officially recognized with historical markers since 1961 and 1999 as the oldest street, but some historians now argue that Magallanes Street, which follows the traditional Spanish urban layout connecting important colonial structures, may be the true oldest street.\n\nGiven that the traditional and widely accepted answer is Colon Street, and considering this is a historical trivia question likely referencing the conventional understanding, I'll provide that answer.\n\n<answer>Colon Street</answer>",
