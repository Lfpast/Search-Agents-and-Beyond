This response is triggered by chemicals released from damaged vessel-lining cells and pain receptors, and typically lasts up to 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Formation of a Platelet Plug**: Platelets encounter the damaged area with exposed collagen and connective tissue, causing them to clump together, become sticky, and bind to the injury site. They release chemicals like ADP and serotonin that help maintain vasoconstriction and attract more platelets to reinforce the plug.\n\n3. **Coagulation (Blood Clotting)**: This is the most sophisticated phase where a stable fibrin clot forms through a cascade of clotting factors. It involves either the extrinsic pathway (triggered by tissue trauma) or intrinsic pathway (triggered by internal vessel damage), both leading to a common pathway that produces fibrin strands to seal the wound permanently.\n\n<answer>vascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and coagulation</answer>", "total_search_steps": 2}}

It was named after Christopher Columbus (Cristóbal Colón) and has historical markers from 1961 and 1999 designating it as the oldest street.\n\nHowever, **historical evidence now suggests that Magallanes Street** (also in Cebu City) may actually be the oldest street. Historians point out that:\n- The earliest known map showing Colon Street dates to 1873, not the 16th century\n- Magallanes Street was part of the original Spanish settlement grid pattern established around Plaza Sugbu following the Laws of the Indies\n- Colon Street was located outside the original Spanish \"ciudad\" (city) boundaries\n- The claim about Colon Street being the oldest originated from postcards in the early 1900s and was later popularized by travel guides\n\n<answer>Colon Street</answer>\n\nDespite the ongoing historical debate, Colon Street remains the most widely recognized and traditionally accepted answer as the oldest street in the Philippines.", "total_search_steps": 5}}
